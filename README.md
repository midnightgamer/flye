# Flye

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## I made three assumptions 
1. There was no way to set username other than URL, so I added search 
   component.
2. Intently there won't be any user so nothing to show, so I made two pages 
   1. Landing page (Just simple text input and button)
   2. User page (Everything else along with an input and button)
3. When I saw older and newer in design I thought I need to fetch data in 
   most reset format, so I fetched data from new to old 



Note: Before this project I didn't use much of RxJS, so I avoided using in 
this project
